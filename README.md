**Traya** is an AggregateRoot & Event Publishing component built by [Wynd](https://www.wynd.eu) and used by our backend projects.

This project is part of the _Sith Triumvirate_ project with:
- [Nihilus](https://github.com/Wynd-Lab/nihilus): CQRS
- Sion: Saga pattern (WIP, not available yet)

Traya requires a specific implementation if you want to publish events (this part is optionnal). Wynd doesn't provide any default implementation because the event management realy depends on the technology/framework you're using (Prooph, Event Store, Kafka, RabbitMQ, ...). More information are available in the documentation.
